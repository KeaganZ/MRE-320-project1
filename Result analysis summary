For the overall experimental results, we conducted three aspects of analysis. From three directions and two physical quantities, we obtained the sensitivity and limitations of the sensor. For error analysis, I selected a more reliable mobile phone sensor app for comparison, and learned that the sensor has some shortcomings in measuring the linear changes in data, which are already larger and smaller peaks. In terms of accuracy, by comparing the data measured by the sensor and the app in the same set of experiments, it can be seen that the data error of the sensor is within the measurement range, and the reliability of the data is acceptable. In the static experiment, the stability of the sensor data was measured, which shows that the sensor is stable.
