# Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 Quan Gu
In this part, we will focuse on Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04. Ultrasonic sensors are sensors that measure distance by propagating ultrasonic waves in the air. If ultrasound hits an object or obstacle along its path, it will bounce back to the sensor. Firstly, the transmitter (trip pin) sends sound waves, which are picked up by the object and reflected to the sensor. The receiver (echo pin) picks it up. As the speed of sound in the air is known, the time between transmission and reception allows for the calculation of the distance between them. The main difficulty with the propagation of ultrasound in air is that the attenuation of by high-frequency ultrasound in air is high so that the range of these devices is relatively short. We will find some important static characteristics of Ultrasonic Module and learn some information about it in this part.
