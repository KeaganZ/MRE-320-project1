MRE 320 Sensors and Actuators Project 1

Understand the sensor characteristics is crucial and should always be one of the top priorities. There are two categories of sensor characteristics that we are interested in â€“ static and dynamic. The dynamic characteristics of a sensor represent the time response of the sensor system. Knowledge of these is essential to fruitfully use a sensor. Important common dynamic responses of sensors include rise time, delay time, peak time, settling time percentage error and steady-state error. The static ones indicate how much the sensor signal correctly represents the measured quantity after it stabilizes (i.e. beyond the transient period.) Important static characteristics of sensors include sensitivity, resolution, linearity, zero drift and full-scale drift, range, repeatability and reproducibility.

In this project, we will use an Arduino Kit that consists of different sensors and measure only the static characteristics of those sensors. We will study the sensors, propose a list of important objectives and testing plans, conduct the testing, collect and analyze the data, and give a presentation to cover our main findings.
