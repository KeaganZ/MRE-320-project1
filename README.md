The project focuses on the MPU6050, a compact motion sensing chip ideal for precision in navigation for industrial and hobbyist applications. The MPU6050 measures six degrees of freedom, capturing three-dimensional acceleration and rotation, crucial for technologies like robotics and flight controls. The experiment involved comparing the MPU6050's sensitivity and range to a smartphone's sensors, assessing accuracy and error through free fall tests, and examining sensor drift over time. The findings suggest while the MPU6050 records physical changes and has a rapid response in angular velocity, it lacks the linearity found in smartphone sensors. Despite its high integration and ease of use, considerations for error, data sampling intervals, and maximum measurement range are necessary for practical applications. Further improvements in the setup to eliminate errors were recommended.
